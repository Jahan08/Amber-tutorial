# AMBER application : G Protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)

Tutorial on the setup and simulation of a membrane protein with AMBER Lipid21 and PACKMOL-Memgen

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a major role in intercellular communication by binding small diffusible ligands (agonists) at the extracellular surface. Agonist-binding induces a conformational change in the receptor, which results in the binding and activation of heterotrimeric G proteins within the cell.
