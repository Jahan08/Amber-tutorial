# AMBER application : G Protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)

Tutorial on the setup and simulation of a membrane protein with AMBER Lipid21 and PACKMOL-Memgen

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a major role in intercellular communication by binding small diffusible ligands (agonists) at the extracellular surface. Agonist-binding induces a conformational change in the receptor, which results in the binding and activation of heterotrimeric G proteins within the cell.

# Introduction:

This tutorial describes how to construct and simulate a GPCR membrane protein system using AMBER. In this case, we will setup and simulate the agonist bound, active state of the M2 muscarinic receptor, the structure of which was solved in 2013 (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12735). The PDB code is 4MQS - active human M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor bound to the agonist iperoxo.
